1. How many maximum number of columns can be added to HBase table?

ANS : restriction on column count would also probably depend on the file format, ORC having indexes and predicate pushdown does not behave as a Text file would. ORC has configurations for number of rows that are grouped together for an index.

2. Why columns are not defined at the time of table creation in HBase?

ANS : Column names are not definined at the time of table creation,they are derived from source table.

3. What happens internally when new data gets inserted into HBase table?

ANS:When you put data into HBase, a timestamp is required. The timestamp can be generated automatically by the RegionServer or can be supplied by you. The timestamp must be unique per version of a given cell, because the timestamp identifies the version. To modify a previous version of a cell, for instance, you would issue a Put with a different value for the data itself, but the same timestamp.
